This Satellite provides widgets to display game schedules and rankings to WordPress.

== Description ==

Satellite to the BVN.ch API This Satellite (https://wordpress.org/plugins/bvn-satellite/‎) provides widgets to 
WordPress. Multiple instances are supported. Backend configuration available. The SDK is currently under 
development, so functions, readme and/or examples will change. If other views are required, I'll try to add 
them in. Feel free to mail me and request your tell me your needs!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the zip to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or download it from the repository
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Use the Admin Panel to select the Club you want to use the plugin for. 
4. Add Widgets to the pages of your choice to display ranking or matches. All necessary parameters can be 
   provided in the widget backend. 
   
   Additional use of plug-in "widget-logic" for different rankings on different pages with same templates is highly recommended.
